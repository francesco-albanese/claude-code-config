description: Commit and push changes using git-ops agent
---

Use the git-ops subagent (Task tool with subagent_type='git-ops') to:
1. Check git status
2. Stage all relevant changes
3. Create a commit with proper message following my conventions
4. Push to remote

If there's nothing to commit, inform me. Handle any issues that arise.
