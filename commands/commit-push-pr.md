description: Commit, push, and create PR using git-ops agent
---

Use the git-ops subagent (Task tool with subagent_type='git-ops') to:
1. Check git status
2. Stage all relevant changes
3. Create a commit with proper message following my conventions
4. Push to remote
5. Create a PR with proper title/description following my conventions

If nothing to commit, skip to PR creation if branch has unpushed commits. Handle any issues that arise.
