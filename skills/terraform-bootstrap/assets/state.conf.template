# Centralized Terraform State Backend Configuration
#
# IMPORTANT: For GitHub OIDC + Cross-Account State Access
# The shared-services terraform role (below) must trust all target account
# terraform roles that will access this state via CI/CD pipelines.
#
# Flow: GitHub OIDC → Target account role → AssumeRole → Shared-services role → S3
#
# See architecture.md for trust policy configuration and setup checklist.
